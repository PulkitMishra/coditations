Less than a minute. Yay! Yeah, this was pretty easy. But still! :


{% highlight c++ %}
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int u=0;
        int l=0;
        for (int i=0;i<moves.length();i++)
        {
            if(moves[i]=='L')
                l++;
            else if(moves[i]=='R')
                l--;
            if(moves[i]=='U')
                u++;
            else if(moves[i]=='D')
                u--;
        }
        if(l==0 && u==0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Gets accepted in the first attempt. Lets move on to some serious stuff.
