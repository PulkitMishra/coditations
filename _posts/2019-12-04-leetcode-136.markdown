I was not really enjoying the questions for some reason and have switched to another track. An easy one : [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/ "Single Number"). I have seen this before and this question exists to display the beauty of XOR.
 
Based on a simple concept that xor of same numbers is always zero, here's the code:

{% highlight c++ %}
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++)
            nums[0]=nums[0]^nums[i];
        return nums[0];
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Key Takeaways :
1. XOR is amazing
