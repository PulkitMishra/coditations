Next up : [Defanging an IP Address](https://leetcode.com/problems/defanging-an-ip-address/ "Defanging an IP Address"). Cool. So, I have seen this before somewhere. Maybe on hackerrank.

Initially, I thought maybe C++ also has a string replace function. Unfortunately it doesn't. In any case, here's a simple implementation.

{% highlight c++ %}
class Solution {
public:
    string defangIPaddr(string address) {
        string ans="";
        for(int i=0;i<address.length();i++)
        {
            if(address[i]=='.')
            {
             ans=ans+"[.]";   
            }
            else
            {
                ans=ans+address[i];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}

This is so easy, I'm not even going to waste a single moment of my life on this.

Key Takeaways :
1. Avoid easy questions maybe(?)
