An easy one : [Sort Array By Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/ "Sort Array By Parity"). I will carry forward today's 4 question tomorrow. So, 9 questions are supposed to be done tomorrow.
 
This in particular is easy. Nothing better can be done than linear time but we can reduce space complexity by in place swapping.

Here's how:


{% highlight c++ %}
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortArrayByParity(vector<int>& A)
    {
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++)
        {
            if(A[i]%2==0)
                swap(A[j++],A[i]);
        }
        return A;
    }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Neat. The basic idea is that we are pulling all even numbers to the front and have maintained a counter i.e. `j` to do the same.

Key Takeaways :
1. In place swapping by swap()
